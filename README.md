3D game - tutorial

This is a game made from a YouTube tutorial.
Thanks to this game I learned about 3D graphics and physics.
Unfortunately I don't have the code (only .exe) so please forgive me for the sounds in the game, as I created the game a few months ago.

# The project includes:
- Game physics
- Score system
- User interface
- Sounds
- Multiple levels

Ball.mp4 shows how the game works.
